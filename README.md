## 🔮 The Concept

**Vibe Check** is a location discovery engine that uses AI and real-time social frequency data to quantify the "vibe" of restaurants, bars, and cafes. 

While traditional apps focus on static star ratings, Vibe Check answers the questions that actually matter: 
* *"Is it loud enough to hide an awkward silence?"*
* *"Is the lighting dim enough for a date?"*
* *"Is the WiFi stable enough for deep work?"*

## ✨ Key Features

* **🤖 AI Vibe Analysis:** Uses **Google Gemini** to read thousands of reviews in seconds and generate a one-sentence "Vibe Summary" (e.g., *"Neon-lit coding haven with strong espresso"*).
* **📍 Real-Time Spatial Data:** Integrated with **Google Maps Platform (2025 SDK)** for accurate location, hours, and photos.
* **🧊 3D Interactive Elements:** Features "Boba Bot," a custom 3D interactive mascot built with **React Three Fiber**.
* **📊 Dynamic Filters:** Filter by Radius, Budget ($ - $$$$), and specific Moods (Chill, Electric, Buzzing).
* **🗺️ Dual Visualization:** Toggle seamlessly between an immersive **Grid View** and an interactive **Map View**.
* **💾 Collections:** Save your favorite spots to your local "Vibe Collection."
* **🎨 High-Fidelity UI:** A fully responsive, dark-mode-first interface using glassmorphism and smooth framer-motion animations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Nisinii/VibeCheck.git](https://github.com/Nisinii/VibeCheck.git)
cd VibeCheck
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Create a .env file in the root directory. You will need API keys for Google Maps and Google Gemini.
```bash
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_key_here
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
```

### 4. Run the App
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## 📂 Project Structure
```bash
src/
├── assets/          # Static images (Logo, Profile, PDF)
├── components/      # Reusable UI components (NavBar, PlaceCard, Footer)
│   ├── BobaBotComponent.jsx  # The 3D logic
│   └── MapVisualizer.jsx     # Google Maps integration
├── hooks/           # Custom hooks
│   ├── useGoogleMaps.js      # Script loading logic
│   ├── usePlacesFetcher.js   # API search strategies
│   └── useFavorites.js       # LocalStorage logic
├── pages/           # Route views (Home, PlaceDetails, Developer, About)
├── utils/           # Constants and AI helper functions
└── App.jsx          # Main Router configuration
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### The Vibe Engine
The app calculates a "Vibe Score" and "Label" based on a heuristic combination of:
* **User Rating Count:** Determines if a place is "Electric" (High traffic) vs "Chill" (Low traffic).
* **Operational Status:** Dormant vs. Active.
* **Place Types:** Categorizes venues into "Cozy," "Upscale," or "Casual."

### Gemini Integration
When you click on a place, we fetch the 5 most recent detailed reviews and send them to the Gemini Flash Model with a specific prompt engineering structure to extract sentiment without personal bias.
